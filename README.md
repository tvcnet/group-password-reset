# The Hack Repair Guy's Group Password Reset

Bulk reset WordPress user passwords by scope, skip excluded usernames, and optionally notify affected users with secure password reset links.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.8.3 or newer
- PHP 8.3 or newer
- Administrator access to the target site

## Features

- Reset passwords for all users, a single role, or `Administrator (excluding current user)`
- Persist excluded usernames between runs
- Show skipped users in the active results table
- Send secure password reset links by email instead of exposing raw passwords
- Support a reset-only mode that skips email when admins need to communicate through another channel
- Support both JavaScript-enhanced batch processing and a chunked non-JavaScript fallback
- Store async progress per reset run so multiple tabs do not overwrite each other
- Persist only summary counts after completion instead of storing row-level results server-side
- Write audit-log entries for reset job creation and completion

## How It Works

1. Open the **Group Password Reset** admin screen.
2. Choose **All users**, a specific role, or **Administrator (excluding current user)**.
3. Enter comma-separated usernames to exclude.
4. Choose whether to attempt email notifications or run in reset-only mode.
5. Confirm that you want to invalidate current passwords.
6. Start the reset.

With JavaScript enabled, the plugin processes users in batches of 20 and updates the results table in place. Without JavaScript, the form submits through WordPress `admin-post.php`, processes the reset in redirecting batches, and returns to the admin screen with the final summary.

When email mode is enabled, the plugin resets passwords first and then attempts to send secure reset-link emails. Mail failures do not roll back the reset, so the no-email mode is the safer option when admins plan to communicate manually.

## Architecture Notes

- `group-password-reset.php` is the bootstrap file and loads the admin and reset subsystems.
- `includes/admin-menu.php` owns the admin screen, asset registration, and the non-JavaScript form handler.
- `includes/password-reset.php` owns shared reset logic, role-scope handling, summary-backed job state, result formatting, and AJAX endpoints.
- `includes/audit-log.php` owns the audit table schema and event logging.
- `assets/js/admin.js` progressively enhances the admin screen with async batching.
- `assets/css/admin.css` keeps the UI aligned with a native WordPress admin layout.

## Testing Notes

Baseline compatibility target:

- WordPress 6.9
- PHP 8.3

Recommended manual scenarios:

- Reset a single role with multiple users.
- Reset `Administrator (excluding current user)` and verify the current admin is skipped automatically.
- Reset all users while excluding one or more usernames.
- Run the tool with a role that has no users.
- Trigger a run with JavaScript disabled to verify the fallback path.
- Verify results distinguish `success`, `failed`, and `skipped`.
- Verify the audit log records start and completion events without storing target usernames or emails.
- Verify completed runs retain counts-only summary data after reload.

## Release Checklist

- Update the plugin version and changelog.
- Verify `readme.txt` matches the plugin header and current behavior.
- Confirm the admin screen loads without PHP notices.
- Confirm the reset flow works on WordPress 6.9 with PHP 8.3, plus any newer local prerelease builds used for forward-compatibility checks.
