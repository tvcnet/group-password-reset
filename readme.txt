Bulk reset WordPress passwords by scope, skip excluded usernames, and send secure reset links to affected users.

== Description ==

The Hack Repair Guy's Group Password Reset is a native WordPress admin tool for administrators who need to invalidate passwords at scale without manually editing each account.

Use it to:

- reset passwords for a single role
- reset passwords for all users
- reset administrator accounts while automatically excluding the current administrator
- exclude specific usernames from a run
- attempt to notify each affected user with a secure password reset link
- run in reset-only mode without sending email
- review success, failure, and skipped summaries after each run
- retain a durable audit trail for security-sensitive operations

The plugin supports two execution paths:

- JavaScript-enabled browsers process users in batches of 20 and update the results table in place.
- Browsers without JavaScript fall back to a chunked WordPress `admin-post.php` flow that redirects between batches and returns to the admin screen with the same final summary data.

Operational notes:

- Detailed per-user result rows are shown during the active JavaScript run, but only summary counts are persisted after completion.
- When email mode is enabled, passwords are invalidated before reset-link emails are attempted. Mail failures do not roll back the reset.

Compatibility baseline:

- WordPress 6.9
- PHP 8.3

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` screen in WordPress.
3. Open `Group Password Reset` from the WordPress admin menu.
4. Choose `All users`, a specific role, or `Administrator (excluding current user)`.
5. Enter any excluded usernames, confirm the reset, and start the run.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I reset passwords for only one role? =

Yes. Choose a specific role from the dropdown before starting the reset.

= Can I reset all users at once? =

Yes. Leave the role selector on `All users`.

= Can I reset administrator accounts without locking myself out? =

Yes. Choose `Administrator (excluding current user)` to target administrator accounts while automatically skipping the currently logged-in administrator.

= What happens to excluded usernames? =

Excluded usernames are skipped, shown in the results table, and persisted for the next run.

= What email do users receive? =

Each affected user receives a secure WordPress password reset link so they can choose a new password themselves.

= What happens if email delivery fails? =

Passwords are still reset first. If your mail configuration fails, users may be locked out until they receive a reset link through another channel. Use the no-email option if you plan to communicate manually.

= Does the plugin require JavaScript? =

No. JavaScript enables the batched in-page progress UI, but the main reset flow also works through a non-JavaScript fallback.
